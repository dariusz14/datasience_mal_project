## Analysis of MAL statistics

## Description
This project will be used to host Notebooks in which MAL DB will be scraped using Jikan API, to access the database. Visualization and calculations will be made answering different questions.

MAL, short for MyAnimeList, is a website for tracking and enganging in topics about Anime and Manga series, as well as other related media.

The code in project.ipynb is the final version used when demonstrating results to professors. The test_unorg.ipynb includes previous tests while experimenting with Numpy, Pandas and the Jikan API.
